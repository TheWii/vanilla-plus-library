# Vanilla+ Library: Vanilla Recipe Pack
This is a datapack containing all vanilla recipes for the Universal Crafting Table. It's not considered a module by itself, but an addon for the Custom Crafting module, also serving as a guide for users of this library to add their own custom recipes. If you are an user of the Custom Crafting library, I advise you to not directly merge this datapack to yours, but instead you can tell your datapack's users to download this recipepack manually if they want to have access to vanilla recipes through the Universal Crafting Table.
