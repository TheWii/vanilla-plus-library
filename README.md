# Vanilla+ Library

Vanilla+ Library or Vanilla Plus Library is a library datapack created and commonly used by TheWii in their datapacks. It contains a bunch of modules that are installed and uninstalled separately by the datapacks. Some modules are dependent from third modules.

The current available modules are:

- **Loaded Chunk:** Adds a forceloaded chunk containing some useful blocks like a shulker box to manipulate player inventory, sign to resolve json, hopper and dropper for inventory purpose.
- **Click Detections:** Adds a system to detect right-click with carrots on a sticks and warped fungus on a stick. It also adds a villager click system.
- **Block Placement:** Adds a way to simulate custom block placement using Blast Furnaces with a known Lock id.
- **Math:** Adds a LCG for PRNG purpose. 
- **Inventory:** Adds a custom damage system and functions to damage mainhand, offhand and any slot in the inventory. It also adds some basic functions to draw/insert items from containers. **(Requires Loaded Chunk)**
- **Generation:** Adds a world generation system to generate ores and structures using mcfunction. It's currently unused and probably will be removed and replaced by 1.16 WorldGen. **(Requires Math)**
